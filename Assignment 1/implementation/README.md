# Registration Timeline UI – Assignment 1 (CIS 4120)

## Overview
This project implements a static high-fidelity UI mockup of a registration timeline using **HTML and CSS**. The goal was to closely reproduce the provided design reference with attention to layout, spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.

The implementation focuses on clean structure, predictable layout behavior, and readability rather than interactivity.

---

## Implementation Details
The layout is built using semantic HTML elements and modern CSS techniques, including:

- Flexbox for horizontal and vertical alignment
- CSS custom properties (variables) for color consistency
- Pseudo-elements for structural visuals (e.g., the vertical timeline line)
- SVG icons embedded directly in the markup for scalability
- Responsive sizing using relative units and viewport-aware constraints

Special care was taken to align timeline markers, section dividers, and spacing so the visual structure remains consistent across screen sizes.

## Use of AI-Assisted Tools
Some portions of this codebase were initially **AI-assisted**, particularly for parts that are tedious or non-obvious to write from scratch, such as:

- Establishing the initial HTML/CSS structure for the timeline layout
- Fine-tuning flexbox alignment patterns
- Generating SVG markup for icons
- Drafting base CSS for consistent spacing and typography

All generated code was **reviewed, modified, and edited manually**. Layout values, spacing, font sizes, and structural decisions were adjusted iteratively to match the design reference and assignment requirements.

I fully understand every line of code in this project and can explain the purpose and behavior of each component if asked.

## Notes
This project is intentionally static and does not include JavaScript, as the focus of the assignment is visual layout and structure rather than functionality.

Minor visual differences (e.g., color rendering or font antialiasing) may occur due to browser and device differences.
